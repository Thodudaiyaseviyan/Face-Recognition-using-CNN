# Face Recognition using CNN
 A Face recongnition system which uses CNN(Convolutional Nueral Networks) to identify and recognize faces. It uses a large sample class for training the custom CNN model and uses LDA(Linear Discriminant Model) for extracting the features from the image to train the model. The model's performance is evaluated against KNN.
